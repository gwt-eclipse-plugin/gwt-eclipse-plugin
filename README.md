* [Install the target.tbd plugin](https://github.com/mbarbero/fr.obeo.releng.targetplatform) - Install the targets plugin. 
* Once the plugin is installed, right click on the target.tbd file and set the target. 
* Note: The targets will have to be updated by setting the targets. This will regenerate the Eclipse target files.
